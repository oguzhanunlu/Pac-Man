{"name":"Pac-Man","tagline":"Multiplayer Pac-Man","body":"# Pac-Man\r\n\r\nPac-Man is an old yet phenomenal game. We wanted to keep the spirit alive as engineers and developed a multiplayer version of the original game. We aimed nothing but brushing up our knowledge on web development.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/oguzhanunlu/Pac-Man/blob/master/ss.png\" >\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWe are students of [the Department of Computer Engineering](http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/) at [Middle East Technical University](http://www.metu.edu.tr/). We both took [CENG498 course](http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/course/ceng498/index) during Fall 15 and developed this project as course project.\r\n\r\n## Installation & How To Run\r\n\r\n- Clone the project, `git clone git@github.com:oguzhanunlu/Pac-Man.git`\r\n- Go to directory, `cd Pac-Man`\r\n\r\nThis project is composed of a Python library (see `server.py`) and a Django project (see `pacman/`).\r\n\r\n**Important Notice** \r\n\r\nYou are likely to see a Django error like below, \r\n```\r\nYou have unapplied migrations; your app may not work properly until they are applied.\r\nRun 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.\r\n```\r\nTo fix that, simply running `python manage.py migrate` command at main directory of Django project, `pacman/` , is enough. Now you are safe to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Run library first, `python server.py`\r\n- Fire up another terminal window, `CTRL+SHIFT+T` on Ubuntu\r\n- Time to run Django project now, `cd pacman && python manage.py runserver 0:8000`\r\n- Open a browser and type `localhost:8000` into address bar.\r\n- Press `Enter` and enjoy the game!\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n- [Erkan Tomruk](https://github.com/erkantomruk)\r\n- [Oguzhan Unlu](https://github.com/oguzhanunlu)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nPac-Man is open sourced under GPL v2. See `LICENSE` file.\r\n***\r\nBuilt by hugs and bugs in cold and grey city of Ankara, Turkey.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
