# Pac-Man

Pac-Man is an old yet phenomenal game. We wanted to keep the spirit alive as engineers and developed a multiplayer version of the original game. We aimed nothing but brushing up our knowledge on web development.

## Motivation

We are students of [the Department of Computer Engineering](http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/) at [Middle East Technical University](http://www.metu.edu.tr/). We both took [CENG498 course](http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/course/ceng498/index) during Fall 15 and developed this project as course project.

## Installation & How To Run

- Clone the project, `git clone git@github.com:oguzhanunlu/Pac-Man.git`
- Go to directory, `cd Pac-Man`

This project is composed of a Python library (see `server.py`) and a Django project (see `pacman/`).

- Run library first, `python server.py`
- Fire up another terminal window, `CTRL+SHIFT+T` on Ubuntu
- Time to run Django project now, `cd pacman && python manage.py runserver 0:8000`
- Open a browser and type `localhost:8000` into address bar.
- Press `Enter` and enjoy the game!
